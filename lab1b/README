= Description of Included Files =
=================================

lab1b-server.c
	C source module.
	
	Contains code for server implementation which accepts 
	connections from a single client through a socket. A child 
	shell process, which was forked, processes the commands and
	outputs the result into a pipe back to server. This is then
	sent through the socket to the client.
	
	Accepts the following options:
                --port=PORTNUM
                        to specify port used for connection
                --compress
                        will enable compression of all traffic in both
                        directions

lab1b-client.c
	C source module.
	
	Contains code for client implementation which connects to the
	server under a specified port number via a socket. It takes 
	input from the terminal and sends it to the socket. Output is
	given from the server and displayed on the terminal.

	Accepts the following options:
		--port=PORTNUM
			to specify port used for connection
		--log=filename
			maintains a record of data sent over the socket
		--compress
			will enable compression of all traffic in both
			directions


Makefile
	used to build the program and tarball

	targets
		default: build lab1b-server and lab1b-client 
			 executables

		clean: delete all files created by Makefile, and 
		       return directory to fresh state
	
		dist: build distribution tarball

README
	used to provide extra information

= Additional Notes =
====================

This lab delt with a lot of code, so I used modulation to allow for 
easier debugging.

In addition to working off some of my lab1a code, I needed to use the
UNIX socket tutorial at:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_sockets/socket_client_example.htm

For zlib, I used:
https://www.zlib.net/manual.html
