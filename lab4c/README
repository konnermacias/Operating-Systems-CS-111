== Included Files ==
====================

lab4c_tcp.c
	C source file that opens a TCP connection to the server at the
	specified address and port then immediately sends an ID over
	the connection. It also sends temperature reports.

	

	Correct Usage: ./lab4c_tcp portnumber --id=9-digit-ID-number
			 --log=log_file --host=address [--scale=CF]
			 [--period=num_seconds]


lab4c_tls.c
	C source file that opens a TLS to the server at the specified
	address and port. This is based on the remote logging
	from building lab4c_tcp. It also sends an ID and temperature
	reports over the connection.

	Correct Usage: ./lab4c_tls portnumber --id=9-digit-ID-number 
                         --log=log_file --host=address [--scale=CF] 
                         [--period=num_seconds]

	
Makefile
	Used to build and test the program. Please note that this
	Makefile is intended to be executed on a BeagleBone.

	Targets:
		default:
			builds both lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls
		clean:
			deletes all programs and output created by
			the Makefile and restores the directory to 
			its freshly untarred state.
		dist:
			creates deliverable tarball.

README
	Text file that contains descriptions of included files and 
	comments about the project.

I unfortunately had a tough time dealing with connection once again.
I had used my personal wifi, but was unable to run:

$ sudo apt-get update

After going through numerous online sites trying to fix the issue, I
finally was able to complete the command and install openssl.
