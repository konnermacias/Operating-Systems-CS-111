= Limitations =
===============

I had passed all the tests via the sanity check script except for the
one checking if SIGINT was reported. Following a post on piazza, I 
edited the script file to say SEND '^C\r' instead of SEND '^C'. This 
made me pass all tests.

= Other Comments =
==================

I personally did my debugging gradually as I worked on the assignment.
Though I accept the debug option, it doens't do much as I was able to
already solve a lot of my program issues. Also, it was not specified
in the grading rubric so I feel alright with this decision for now.
