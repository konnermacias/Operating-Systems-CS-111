=================================
= Description of Included Files =
=================================

lab0.c
	C program that copies its standard input to its standard
	output.
	
	Accepts the following options:
		--input=filename
			uses specified file as standard input
		--ouput=filename
			create specified file and use it as standard
			output
		--segfault
			force a segmentation fault, and do not copy
			from stdin to stdout
		--catch
			register a SIGSEGV handler that catches
			segmentation fault 
	

Makefile
	Used to build the program and tarball
	
	targets
		default: build lab0 executable
		
		check: runs a quick smoke-test to check if program
		       works, supports the required arguments, and
		       and properly reports success or failure
		
		clean: delete all files created by Makefile, and 
		       return directory to fresh state

		dist: build distribution tarball

====================================
= Smoke-test cases in check target =
====================================

testSucess:
	check for errors handling --input and --output options. Also,
	check if input and output contents are not the same.

testInvalidArg:
	check for errors handling unrecognized arguments.

testCatch:
	check if the program does not catch the segmentation fault.

testInput:
	check for errors handling non-existant or unreadable input
	files.

testCreat:
	check for errors handling uncreatable output files.

=====================
= My Personal Input =
=====================

I used the man pages, and several online tutorials to remind myself 
in creating a Makefile and writing scripting code.

I also used the tutorial in input/output redirection to help with 
writing lab0.c.
