I added the single block field for the symlink as if it were a 
block pointer to match the csv output.

From Piazza: 
"There is a second problem, with the csv output for symlinks, 
which currently displays a single block field, the first four 
bytes of the name, as if they were a block pointer.

 

Given that people are already working on this project, I 
suggest that I not correct this error (at this instant) and 
simply have you produce the same output as the csv sample.  I 
put this to a vote yesterday in class, and (a) there were not 
strong opinions and (b) more people favored not changing the 
problem after it had been started."
